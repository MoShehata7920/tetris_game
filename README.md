Welcome to the Tetris Game repository! This classic game brings back nostalgic memories while providing an enjoyable and challenging experience. Play the game and see how many lines you can clear.

## Gameplay

In Tetris, various shaped blocks called tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen. Your goal is to rotate and move these tetrominoes as they descend to create solid lines across the playing field. Each completed line disappears, giving you points and making room for more tetrominoes.

## Features

- Intuitive controls for moving and rotating tetrominoes
- Score tracking and level progression
- Increasing game speed as you clear more lines
- Game over when tetrominoes reach the top
